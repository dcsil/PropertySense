### Team Leader

[Sunny Kim, Engineering](./sunny_kim.md)
<!-- Describe who and why the team leader was selected --> 
Sunny was selected (temporarily) due to his experience with managing teams using agile and since he set up the repo and github project. If we get a new member from CSC454 business side of things, we may re-assign the leader to someone with more domain specific knowledge of the business logic of the startup.

#### Responsibilities
<!-- What is their role for your team?	--> 
- Create relevant issues/tickets on github projects
- Ensure steady progress on the project board and communicate with team to be aware of any blockers
- Communicate with course instructors if anything needs to be escalated
- Ensure that scope of work stays focused and that work is delegated based on requirements
