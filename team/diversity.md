# Diversity in PropertySense

PropertySense's user base consists of insurance brokers and inspectors all throughout the industry with varying backgrounds and perspectives. Although, there is no doubt that there is a constraint in the types of people that we are target to use the application, we want our application to be available to the widest net, meaning that we must be agnostic to the diversity inherent in the individuals that make up our SOM. This document elaborates on how PropertySense can meet those diversity needs, where we are weak, and our strategy to fill in the gaps. 

Team Background & Strengths
---
Sunny was born in South Korea and grew up following South Korean customs in his home. He has also spent time growing up in the rural Maritimes, being influenced by french-canadian/acadian culture, spending his youth playing hockey and speaking French. His diverse cultural experience give him a wide perspective that aligns with both east and western values, along with a metropolitan and rural experiences. He has lived in both full sized homes under a single mother running airbnbs in the basement, shared condo units, and student housing in downtown Toronto, with roommate from India, Bangladesh, Hong Kong and more. This has shaped his understanding of how the value living spaces are established differently based on varying superstitions, religions, cuisines, and customs.

David was born in Armenia and grew up in Canada, where he was raised with both Armenian and Canadian customs. This mix of cultures has given him an appreciation for different perspectives and ways of life. David brings experience in full-stack software development, gained through both professional work and academic research projects. His skills allow him to take on frontend development and UI-focused responsibilities, ensuring the product is both functional and user-friendly. Beyond this, he has worked with AI APIs in past projects, giving him practical experience working with AI tools and integrating them into projects.

Carol was born in China, and moved to Vancouver, Canada when she was 10. She has spent her formative years in both Canada and various provinces in China, being influenced by many diverse cultures. A lot of times she also thinks and feels differently from people around her, with a focus on detail and related topics, contributing to the diversity of ideas. Carol has lived in 3 different cities in China, suburban Vancouver in Canada, and an old college residence in Toronto. She has also lived with family members with a variety of different living habits. These first hand experiences can help inform understanding of different living spaces and how they're chosen. Carol also has a passion for art, her main hobby since she was very young. Through years of drawing and arts classes she has developed robust visual intuition and skills to express creativity. These skills allow her to design UI and UX, and can also help with the computer vision side of the project.


## Weak Spots

Our team's various backgrounds still don't fill all the gaps required to understand the perspective of our user base primarily consisting of insurance brokers and inspectors. We recognize that no amount of data analysis can give the full perspective on the subjective annoyances and problems encountered by workers in this industry (at their individual level). To mitigate this, we shouldn't overlook the insights we gain from customer surveys and other forms of feedback, plus advice from domain specific experts. Another point to consider is that we are all engineers with a strong affinity for problem-solving in a logical, pragmatic manner. This may pigeonhole our thinking and therefore solutions into a product that only caters for these kinds of individuals, while the actual audiences may want a product that provides them with more holistic, macroscopic information. This will be especially important for UI/UX.


Beyond our backgrounds as engineers, we attempt to represent personal demographics in terms of gender, ethnic background, and sexual orientation. Despite this, we are still matching the diverse distribution of insurance brokers. An example of this is the age of our team. According to the Insurance Institute of Canada <sup>[[1]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.insuranceinstitute.ca/-/media/InsuranceInstitute/Research-Reports/PDF/2023-Demographic-Research-Report-EN.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjv09W8peGPAxW0g4kEHY6HOgIQFnoECBgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw01C9z5oIWDTs-WrqSmYz35)</sup>, the median age of insurance brokers is 40. This is in stark contrast to our group which are all similar in age around the early 20s. This may affect preferences in UI, and platforms preferred. This is why we are focusing on providing a web-first approach rather than mobile-first.


## Subject Matter Experts

In order to mitigate these gaps in our expertise, we can consult licensed insurance adjusters and property inspectors such as from the Insurance Institute of Canada or local chapters in Toronto. They can provide experience and insight on the property assessment process, like photo quality for accurate scoring. We can also potentially use existing connections some of our team members have (eg. Gary for his experience selling condos). For computer vision, we can reach out to UofT professors working in this field like Sanja Fidler and David Lindell about advice on designing our CV model and pipeline. We can also connect with insurtech experts from firms like Verisk via online meetings for their industry-specific knowledge.


## Customer Diversity

Our teamâ€™s diversity has limits when compared to our intended user base of insurance brokers and inspectors. First, we are all young, in our early 20s, whereas most users are significantly older, with different work habits, priorities, and expectations. This may lead to mismatched expectations around workflows and platform preferences. Second, we all come from a software and computer science background, which means we naturally focus on technical, logical solutions. This could result in overlooking practical challenges or subjective frustrations that professionals experience daily. To address these gaps, we will actively seek user feedback, conduct surveys, and consult with domain experts to ensure the product reflects the real needs and preferences of the target users.


## How this can impact us

Considering diverse perspectives is vital in generating a robust solution, in addition to the importance of a accessibility for user experience. Our approach to product development incorporates diverse expertise and cross-user validation strategies. We collaborate with domain experts and apply inclusive testing protocols across all stages of development. Recognizing that refinement is ongoing, we sustain open feedback mechanisms to drive continual enhancement and inclusivity in our product.
